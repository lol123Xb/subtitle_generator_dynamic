# Real-time subtitle generator with dynamic word wrapping and font size

This is basically a fork of [DevadattaP](https://github.com/DevadattaP/subtitle_generator)'s work which I stumbled upon when trying to find free apps that allowed for live transcription/real-time captions and I genuinely could not believe it was legit 😂 especially since it was quite new.

Regardless, the installation instructions are the same as his, just make sure you go into the `transcriber.py` file and change `local_files_only` to `false` for the initial installation, then change it back to `true` afterwards. This step wasn't listed in his readme and confused the everliving heck out of me until I properly read inside the files 😂 so hopefully this being mentioned here, will help save you the headache.

I only made the word wrapping and font size dynamic for the **audio subtitle generator**, so don't expect the video one to have the same, but I believe both are coded the same so you can just copy and paste the audio one directly into the video one and it should be fine. I haven't tested it myself as I have no use for the video one at the moment.

**EDIT:** Turns out it is the same for OCR/video, I've updated the code to reflect the changes.

There's no opacity in the overlay code as I am on **Zorin**, an **Ubuntu** OS so it cannot have transparent windows unless you use a random gnome extension called "[transparent window](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1454/transparent-window/)".

Anyway, I hope y'all enjoy the free real-time subtitles like I did and make sure to support [DevadattaP](https://github.com/DevadattaP/subtitle_generator) by checking out any of their other creations if they have any 🫡. Thanks for the creation, king 👑.
